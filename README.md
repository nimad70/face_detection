# Junior Computer Vision Engineer Technical Assignment

This project aims to build a face detection system. It involves using OpenCV for face detection, create a customized dataset to fine-tune a  pretrained neural networkl for smile classification, and containerizing the application with Docker.

## Features
- Captures video from a webcam.
- Processes frames
- Detects faces using OpenCV pre-trained classifiers.
- Trains a binary classifier to distinguish between smiling and non-smiling faces.
- Automates execution with a Bash script.
- Containerized with Docker.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow
- Docker
- Bash
